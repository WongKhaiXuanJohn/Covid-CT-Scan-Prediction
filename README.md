# Covid-CT-Scan-Prediction
Another side project which related to medical field. As we all knew Covid hits us hard even until now, global economy dropped significantly and tons of motality cases had happened.

Hence, I am here to contribute a little to the society (or whoever interested in this project) by creating a deep learning model to predict Covid-19 CT Scans. With this model, it can significantly increase the effectiveness and efficiency of checking whether patients are positive or negative in Covid based on their CT scans.
